This repository contains the full list of the neural network predictions for the classes (AGN, PSR, YNG, MSP) of unlabelled sources in the Fermi-LAT 4FGL-DR2 catalog of gamma-ray sources as obtained in the work: arXiv:2012.XXX 

'Classification of Fermi-LAT sources with deep learning using energy and time spectra'

by Thorben Finke, Michael Kraemer, Silvia Manconi (Institute for Theoretical Particle Physics and Cosmology, RWTH Aachen University). 

The lists of sources are provided as .npz files, together with a small script to read them. 

If you use the lists of source candidates, please refer to: arXiv:2012.XXX
